#global Trend Versus Local trend for your city

IN this project I used a simple data set for each country and the avg temp for that country and the avg temperature for the global trend 
I will compare weather global trend with my country and plotting the moving avg for them.
I used Excel to get moving average for local and global data and I used R for plotting the moving average.

after calculating Movig avg in excl for 5 years and plotting the line chart plots for my city cairo and the global trend to compare the weather you can find that the weather in cairo is hotter than the global trend except for about 2 years there was a peak shows that the weather was cooler.
